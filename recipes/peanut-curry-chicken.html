    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>John's peanut chicken curry recipe doesn't follow a specific recipe from any particular country or culture; 
    instead, it's a simple composite of every peanut curry he's ever come across. 
    No use of coconut milk, as he feels that's a little too sweet and rich for the peanut butter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Spice Blend:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Curry:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the spice blend: Mix salt, coriander, cumin, turmeric, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Make the curry: Place chicken in a large bowl. Add 1/2 of the spice blend and mix until chicken is thoroughly coated. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy pot over high heat. Add 1/2 of the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat to brown remaining chicken. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, add onion to the chicken drippings, and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Add garlic and ginger; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
            Add remaining spice blend; cook and stir for 1 minute. 
            Pour in chicken broth; add browned chicken plus accumulated juices. Stir in peanut butter, ketchup, and brown sugar; bring to a simmer. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle, steady simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. 
            Stir in zucchini, bell pepper, poblano pepper, and 1/2 cup peanuts; 
            continue to simmer until chicken juices run clear and vegetables are fork-tender, 30 to 40 minutes. 
            Remove from the heat. </li>
        <li> Serve curry over rice with a squeeze of lime. Garnish with cilantro and more peanuts as desired.</li>
    </ol>
