    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>This is the best brisket you will ever taste! No matter who comes for dinner, they always make sure that I'll be making this brisket.
    It is a very traditional dish for Rosh Hashanah and Passover but it certainly is a winner any time of the year for anyone who loves very tender beef.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef brisket</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>½ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 glove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat brisket in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook until browned on all sides. 
            Stir in water, ketchup, vinegar, onions, garlic, brown sugar, and salt. 
            Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to medium-low. 
            Continue simmering until tender, turning brisket occasionally, 2 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours and 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove brisket and allow to cool before slicing the meat against the grain. 
            Place brisket slices in a 9x13-inch baking pan or large platter and pour gravy on top. 
            Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove any excess fat and reheat before serving. </li>
    </ol>
